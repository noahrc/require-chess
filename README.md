require-chess
=============

A chess game created as a test project using require.js for modules

Code is organized into basic models and views. The logic determining if a piece can move to a given square is contained in small JSON files, called conditions, making the game logic easier to modify or extend. 

Currently not a fully functional game. Missing features, like checkmate and exchanging pawn pieces.
